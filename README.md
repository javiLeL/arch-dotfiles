## Dunst

> Dunst is the notification daemon how I decided install because it is very lightweight

| Low   | Normal | Crittcal |
| ----- | ------ | -------- |
| `img` | `img`  | `img`    |

## Rofi 

> For launch applications I use `Rofi` because despite being less lightweight than Dmenu, it has a simpler customization system than Dmenu because it is based on css.

## File Explorer

> Actually I am using `Nemo` as my main file explorer. But previously I was using `ranger` is easier to handle with a gui

> Other good option is `nautilus` but it puts the closing bar to close and increase and I dont like this
